# Front-End Architecture Project with Next.js and Monorepo

## Overview

This project is part of a course on Front-End architecture, focused on building scalable and well-structured applications using Next.js and a Monorepo approach. The goal is to demonstrate effective practices for organizing and standardizing Front-End projects, especially in complex development environments.

## Project Goals

- **Monorepo Implementation:** Set up a single repository to manage multiple related projects, making organization and maintenance easier.
- **Using Next.js:** Configure and develop applications with Next.js, leveraging its features for server-side rendering and page creation.
- **Configuration Standardization:** Establish consistent practices for TypeScript, testing, and linking configurations within a project.
- **Code Reuse:** Demonstrate how to reuse and share configurations and components between different parts of a project to enhance efficiency and scalability.
- **Application Management:** Create and manage applications with public and private components, learning to structure and organize different parts of a project.

## Project Structure

The repository is divided into various projects and modules, each with a specific purpose. The basic structure is as follows:

- **`/packages`**: Contains the different projects and shared libraries.
  - **`/app`**: Main application project using Next.js.
  - **`/components`**: Library of reusable components.
  - **`/utils`**: Utility functions and helpers.
  
- **`/configs`**: Shared configurations for TypeScript, ESLint, and tests.

- **`/scripts`**: Scripts for task automation and project setup.
